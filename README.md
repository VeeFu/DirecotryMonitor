# DirectoryMonitor

## Plan

    [ ] Setup github project
    [ ] Build Working prototype in constole application for Win32
        FindFirstChangNotification and WaitForMultipleObjects seem to be the relevant functions for Win32
    [ ] Design platform-agnositc interface
        Since cross-platform was mentioned in intoductory interview, this seems like a relevant iteration
    [ ] Refactor prototype to use new interface
